                    <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,</p>
                    <p>I am very pleased to be here today at the launch of Australia's celebration of the 1993 International Year of the World's Indigenous People.</p>
                    <p>It will be a year of great significance for Australia. It comes at a time when we have committed ourselves to succeeding in the test which so far we have always failed.</p>
                    <p>Because, in truth, we cannot confidently say that we have succeeded as we would like to have succeeded if we have not managed to extend opportunity and care, dignity and hope to the Indigenous people of Australia - the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people.</p>
                    <p>This is a fundamental test of our social goals and our national will: our ability to say to ourselves and the rest of the world that Australia is a first rate social democracy, that we are what we should be - truly the land of the fair go and the better chance.</p>
                    <p>There is no more basic test of how seriously we mean these things. It is a test of our self-knowledge.</p>
                    <p>Of how well we know the land we live in. How well we know our history. How well we recognise the fact that, complex as our contemporary identity is, it cannot be separated from Aboriginal Australia.</p>
                    <p>How well we know what Aboriginal Australians know about Australia. Redfern is a good place to contemplate these things.</p>
                    <p>Just a mile or two from the place where the first European settlers landed, in too many ways it tells us that their failure to bring much more than devastation and demoralisation to Aboriginal Australia continues to be our failure.</p>
                    <p>More I think than most Australians recognise, the plight of Aboriginal Australians affects us all.</p>
                    <p>In Redfern it might be tempting to think that the reality Aboriginal Australians face is somehow contained here, and that the rest of us are insulated from it.</p>

            <h3>NO FIXED ADDRESS: Nomads and the Fate of the Planet</h3>

                <p><strong>Title of the Document/Publication:</strong> "NO FIXED ADDRESS: Nomads and the Fate of the Planet"</p>
                <p><strong>Journal:</strong> Quarterly Essay</p>
                <p><strong>Publisher:</strong> Black Inc Press</p>
                <p><strong>Year of Publication:</strong> 2006</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This essay by Robyn Davidson explores the contrast between sedentary agricultural societies and nomadic cultures, drawing on her experiences in the Indian Himalayas, the Australian Outback, and Tibet. Davidson examines the environmental and social consequences of settled life, arguing that poverty drives ecological destruction in places like the Kumaon region of India.</p>
                <p>She reflects on the historical shift from nomadic hunter-gatherer societies to agriculture, using the allegory of Cain and Abel from Genesis to highlight the perceived decline in health, leisure, and egalitarianism associated with settled life. The author contrasts Western linear time and materialistic values with the Aboriginal concept of the Dreaming, emphasizing their deep connection to the land and egalitarian social structures.</p>
                <p>She also discusses the challenges faced by modern nomads in Tibet and Rajasthan, who are increasingly pressured to settle by governments and economic forces, leading to the loss of traditional ways of life and ecological damage. Davidson suggests that nomadic thinking, which prioritizes working with the environment rather than against it, offers a resilient and rational approach to fragile ecosystems.</p>
